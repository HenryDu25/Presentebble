# Overview
There are many tools that can be used to aid in a visual presentation, but most of them are too noticeable and restrict a presenter's presenting options. For example, presenter view for PowerPoint forces the presenter to standing in front of the laptop screen to view notes, limiting interactions with audience members.

Presentebble makes a presentation look polished and presentebble by seamlessly integrating various tools for presentation management into the pebble watch. Speaker notes on the watch can replace cue cards, while powerpoint control buttons on the pebble watch replace presentation remotes. Both these features are more subtle than their counterparts, but provide the same functionality. Managing a presentation's duration can also be easily done using the timer integrated in the presentebble app.
